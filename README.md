# artifactory-kernel-check

This is a self-contained script to check for a kernel or RHEL update from a baseline system. This script will notify you once that a new update is ready. It will shut off after a notification and file signaling this are created. A file named "available" will also be present to be used as a trigger for using this information. Once the kernel or version has been updated, it will turn back on and begin notifying you of new releases. 

Setup:

    git clone https://github.com/kalantal/artifactory-kernel-check.git
    cd artifactory-kernel-check/
    sudo mkdir -p /auto/bin/
    sudo cp artifactory-kernel-check.sh /auto/bin/artifactory-kernel-check.sh
    sudo chmod +x /auto/bin/artifactory-kernel-check.sh
    #Edit "to" field
